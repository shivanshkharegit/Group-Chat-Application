Java Group Chat Application

A desktop-based group chat application developed using Core Java, Swing, and Socket Programming.
The application follows a client–server architecture and enables real-time communication between multiple users over a local network.

#Overview

This project demonstrates how real-time messaging systems work at a fundamental level using Java sockets.
A centralized server handles multiple client connections simultaneously and broadcasts messages to all connected users.
The client-side interface is built using Java Swing with a modern chat-style layout.

#System Architecture

The server listens on a specific port.

Each client connects to the server using a socket.

The server maintains a list of connected clients.

Messages sent by one client are broadcast to all clients.

Each client runs a separate thread to receive messages continuously.
